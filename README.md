# Color Tetris
Tetris clone in Pygame in 250 lines of code or less.

## Description
I made this game in 2018 in order to teach myself some game programming.
Strictly procedural style with global variables. No OOP, no patterns, no boilerplate.
It doesn't strictly follow all the Tetris guidelines.

## Requirements
* python 3.x
* pygame 1.9.x

## Bugs
If you play long enough you may encounter an invisible garbage piece in the way of the figure. I didn't track this bug down.

## Improvements
What can be implemented:

* 7-bag random generation
* Hard Drop timer
* Lock Delay
* Next piece preview
* Animations
* Sound and music
* Pause
* Menu / Intro screen
